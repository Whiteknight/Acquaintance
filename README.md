# Acquaintance

You can stay in touch without having to be all up in each others' business.

## Project

Acquaintance is a library for the internal messaging needs of a loosly-coupled application. Using a messaging technology such as Acquaintance, individual components in your software can communicate without having to maintain explicit references to each other or worry about order of initialization.

Acquaintance implements several messaging patterns: **Publish/Subscribe**, **Request/Response** and **Scatter/Gather**. In addition to these three primary patterns, Acquaintance provides several additional features and patterns to aide in communication and code organization.

See the [Project Website](https://Whiteknight.github.com/Acquaintance/) for detailed documentation and examples.
