# Acquaintance

You can stay in touch without having to be all up in each others' business.

## Project

Acquaintance is an in-memory message bus and safe concurrency engine. It provides the mechanisms to support modular and loosely-coupled applications, easy work distribution between threads and serialization of work for thread-unsafe resources. 

At it's core, Acquaintance implements several messaging patterns: **Publish/Subscribe**, **Request/Response** and **Scatter/Gather**. These three patterns represent a fundamental basis for implementing more complex patterns and workflows to improve communication and code organization.

See the [Project Website](https://Whiteknight.github.com/Acquaintance/) for detailed documentation and examples.
